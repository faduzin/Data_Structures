# Data Structures from Scratch

Welcome to the **Data Structures from Scratch** repository! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to the implementation of various data structures and their fundamental operations from the ground up using **Python**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This project is designed to:

- Reinforce understanding of core data structures.
- Explore the implementation of basic and advanced operations.
- Serve as a reference for learning and teaching purposes.

Each data structure includes:

- A detailed implementation.
- Explanations for key methods.
- Example usage demonstrating how to work with it.

## 📚 Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Linear Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Deque)

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)

### 3. Hashing
- Hash Tables
- Open Addressing and Chaining Techniques

### 4. Advanced Structures
- Tries
- Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)
- Segment Trees

## 🔧 Features

Each data structure implementation includes:

- Initialization
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Traversals (where applicable)
- Optimization techniques (for certain structures)
